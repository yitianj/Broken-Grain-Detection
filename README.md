# Broken-Grain-Detection

Discription:

The broken grain detection is a key step towards the development of modern agriculture. We approach it as a binary classification problem with automatically extracted features. After examining various machine learning algorithms, decision tree and random forest are proven to be the most effective and explainable models.
